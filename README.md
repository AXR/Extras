The AXR Project
===============
The AXR Project is a revolutionary open source project that will fundamentally improve our tools to create web sites and apps.

It's much in the style of current web standards, using plain text files linked together to create the final site, but with a complete separation of content and presentation, where the content is pure semantic data written in XML, and the presentation and behavior layer is written in HSS, a new language based on CSS, but with many powerful features, such as hierarchical notation, object orientation, modularization for code reuse, expressions (math), vector graphics, references (bindings between objects), and a very long etc.

Extras
======
This is the repository where we keep tools, and extras for the AXR project. This can be Code Completion and Syntax Highlighting for text editors. Basically anything that does not fit in the other repositorys. If you are in doubt, you can consult the wiki or contact the respository manager.

For more infomation about available plugings and extras, see the wiki page here: http://axr.vg/wiki/Extras.

Where to file bug reports
=========================
Please create a new issue here: https://github.com/AXR/Extras/issues/new. To make the process of fixing bugs easier, developers need to know what causes the problem and also on what platform it happens. Be as detailed as possible, and make sure to include the following points in your bug report:

    - What is happening.
    - What did you expect to happen.
    - How to reproduce.
    - Your operating system's version.
    - Which version of the prototype is affected.
